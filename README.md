# Business Understanding
### project goal
The zillow  Dataset contains a wealth of information about the RegionName, City , Metro and various other features of houses in the United States of America . This project will disect how AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models in Python  help predict house prices. IN doing this  the Horizon Real Estate Agency can render constructive advices to homeowners of when they can buy or sell their houses and by what amount.This project considers several  factors that should be looked into when performing this task.

### Business Understanding
### Overview
Real estate is a lucrative business in any economy due to various factors including the rate of population increase in most countries. Over the last decade, the housing market in the United States has seen every end of the housing spectrum. Real estate market trends peaked more than 10 years ago during the Great Recession. For the most of this year, competition propelled what appeared to be the hottest housing market prices in the industry's history. Buyers were forced to compete with many offers on each home, tipping the scales heavily in favor of sellers. Due to a supply and demand imbalance, homeowners were given an edge. It should be remembered, however, that the approaching prospect of a recession, along with the greatest inflation rate recorded in the US housing market in over four decades, has compelled the Federal Reserve to take extreme action. To battle inflation and slow the economy, the Fed has implemented a number of rate rises, the most significant of which would more than quadruple mortgage rates by 2022.

#### Data Understanding

`RegionName` - 	Names of the Regions (Zipcodes)
  
`City` - names for the regions
  
`State` -	Names of the states
  
`Metro` -	Names of metropolitan areas
  
`County Name` -	Names of counties
  
`Size Rank` -	Rank of Zipcodes by urbanization

# Data Preparation
Within our data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
 - Clean Data
    - Checking Duplicates
    - Filled Missing Values
    
---------
# Modeling
We build a time series models using different featuers in our dataset to predict five best locations to invest in based on their return of investment (ROI).
The models include.  

        - Auto Regressive model(AR)
        
        - moving Average model(MA)
        
        - ARMA model
        
        - ARIMA model
        
        - SARIMA model

# Evaluation

---------
# Conclusion
There are several discrepancies within the housing investment sector. Investors would rather invest in some cities than others, which is evident from the varying number of properties in the different cities.

The top three cities with the highest median house prices are Atherton (California), Palm Beach(Florida), and Snowmass Village (Colorado).

The cities with the highest ROI in 22 years are New York, Georgia state, New York, and Hawaii.

Houses in New York have the highest home values, followed by California.

The prices of houses also differ concerning the city ranks. Homes in highly-ranked cities have high median prices.

Other factors, such as location also dictate changes in the price of house prices. For instance, houses in the coastal regions have higher median prices.
